# Unite the Blacksquares - Part 1

> It is from zero, in zero, that the true movement of being begins.
> Kazimir Malevich

One famous quote by the artist Kazimir Malevich could not better describe this community.

It started on Twitter as the beginning of nothing and cultivated into the beginning of everything.

Tweet readers given cryptic images and codes; looked for prophets who could understand that message.

## Looking for choosing the ones.

Everything starts with a black square and ends in a black square.

From the beginning on, the masterminds behind this project recognized users' participation.

You could have earned a **blacklist** spot if you retweeted or reacted to the posts.

## Then Mr. Malevich announced a word.

It takes twenty-five Blacksquares to cover a moment. That is the sum of blacksquares on the given image on Twitter.

It takes one-thousand-three-hundred Blacksquares and a Manifesto to describe us as human beings.

Illuminate the moment behind the Blacksquare and decrypt the Manifesto.

So the users will decide if the Blacksquares will ever illuminate, and the moment underneath will be revealed.

Also that code was given `4cec2c64b54f9b0aa3c0915843d0fedd2018b243a961b2239cb737d6bd7748ed` that has become useful in a later stage.

After that, the illumination on Twitter was reversing, back into a blacksquare.

## And then what?
