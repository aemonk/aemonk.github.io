# Chaos Collective

Chaos Collective made history. They brought us the first multi-resource collaborative music album on [Singular 2.0](https://singular.app/).

There was a collaboration of nine great music artists who gave us 11 signed songs this way.

## That NFT collaboration is the Chaos we need.
