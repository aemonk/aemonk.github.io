# Neon Crisis AMA Twitter Space March 31st Recap


On March 31st, 2022, The Neon Crisis team held a live [Twitter Spaces AMA](https://twitter.com/NeonCrisisNFT/status/1509319863654920192?s=20&t=JSp8jXBjFuWLtUJKYs9C0g) where they gave us more news and updates for the future.

First and foremost, they are making good progress with the RMRK standard, and though they aren’t allowed to announce anything officially, everything is “coming together” as they are focused on making equippables “clean”. They hinted that things are very close to launch-ready, and [Cicada](https://twitter.com/CicadaNCR) stated they are mostly testing the standard and making it more usable for non-devs.

# Updates

Some **general updates** about [Neon Crisis](https://twitter.com/NeonCrisisNFT)

## What was done

- In the first wave of minting, there were 1000 v2 and 136 v1 Neon Crisis NFTs. (total 1136)
- They will reopen the mint for the remaining 4872 NFTs after they've migrated to the RMRK standard.

They are focused on bringing the **community** together, and there will be upcoming drops, easter eggs, and updates in the near future.

## dev

[Cicada](https://twitter.com/CicadaNCR)

- full testing suite
- able to use nesting NFTs
- able to equip NFTs/items into NFTs
- [Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) is doing the frontend for RMRK

Neon Crisis is building hard and is one of the first movers after RMRK. They have the tools and devs to do it. Right after RMRK itself, because of an existing agreement with RMRK, the team will have the first equippable RMRK on an EVM compatible chain.

## Lore

They wanted to thank Pnin and Csaint for helping with writing as both are talented writers.

[Pnin](https://twitter.com/BalanceBorn) has been involved with Science Fiction writing. He and his co-author Silas Crane, were the writers behind the Berserker Valentine's day lore. They are refreshing the entire lore, rebuilding it from the ground up. There is an update coming very soon involving the lore.

[Csaint](https://twitter.com/csaint02) is “everywhere and unbelievable, and also helped us a lot.”

Both Csaint and Pnin are writing for [WagMedia](https://twitter.com/thatMediaWag) and are professionals in their fields. They will continue to spread the word of Neon Crisis and everyone should expect to see some great stuff from them.

## Neon Guard role

Neon Crisis wanted to thank and acknowledge the active members of the community by giving them the Neon Guard role. Currently, there are no concrete plans for this role yet, but they are always thinking about ways to reward their most loyal supporters.

## Valentines day

In February, they had the valentines day drop with “a lot of utility in that drop” that will be announced in the future.

[Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) goes a bit deeper into how it came together:
- the idea came out of nowhere
- they were thinking about something for valentines day
- Yaba came to [Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) with a Valentine’s day gift card
- this was all done just one week before Vday
- They put everything together
- it was super stressful but fun
- They tried to make it as simple as possible, but they kept adding features

[Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) believes that it has to be sexy and look good if something goes out. It is the reputation of the whole team, so it can't be half-hearted stuff.

Thank you to [Elene](https://twitter.com/TsukikoEl); she helped a lot.

Many projects are missing the point; they need to provide more experience. The NC team is trying to build a brand focused on experience, and yes, everything will be built with utility in mind.

**About the drop**:

> everyone who participated will get a notable drop

The valentines card was 100% on-chain messaging, which was epic—people's messages were heartwarming because they meant it. They enjoyed spreading the love. “Love is on the chain.”

**To all who participated**:

> “Thank you from the bottom of our hearts”

## Memory game

Because [Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) wants to add value to everything. The team is very aware you not only hold a Neon Crisis, you hold everything and they want to support this. The Memory Game was a way they could build the community further.

As [Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) said, the memory game isn't original, but he built it because he got inspired. They started with collections from Moonriver and added Singular artist collections to it. There has been great feedback and people are enjoying it.

The idea was just to build a general platform for the community, emphasizing the spirit of collaboration.

**Advice**:
> Lift all boats. Work together.

**Mistakes he made**:
- should not have launched in stealth mode
- should have included smaller collections with less attention

**Next**:
- they actively add new collections to the game
- artists can reach out to get included

## Movr place

Another idea that grew into something bigger.

Movr place is like rplace experience (Reddit place), a community art to raise awareness of each other and contribute to charity. And all that while connecting multiple NFT communities.

- 100% of funds to charity, particularly related to humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.
- Charities can be found on top of the website
- [Lederboard](https://movr.place/leaderboard) as part of movr place
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/xQZ5mv9m3B)

**How it works**:
Contribute to the canvas and submit via multiple transactions.

You can add a community identifier (choose your community) and choose a charity identifier so that you can contribute to whatever charity you prefer.

**Goal**:
Raise as much money for charity as possible as a community while competing.

Movr place dropped as a homage to rplace on April fools. The canvas was live on April 1st for two weeks; as it went on, the costs increased with time. It started at a nickel a pixel and reached a dollar a pixel on the last day.

- pixel data is stored on the blockchain; it will never come down
- everyone who participated will get a NFT

Check out the [official Tweet](https://twitter.com/movr_place/status/1515900629411115008?s=20&t=c_hz-gKJvhJdRIVLmfpG_A) about the final numbers of the genesis canvas.

## Drop

Neon Crisis just dropped something; it was mysterious and teased with silhouettes.

Every NC holder was able to claim a drop; that will be for another NFT in the future. The NC team is planning to communicate all essential pieces of information with the community. They will also release a post about the mechanics and strategies on what to do.

## Elene

Welcome [Elene](https://twitter.com/TsukikoEl)!

She was introduced as a new team member of Neon Crisis.

As NC searched for an art director, she came on the scene. They waited for the announcement for the perfect timing, now. She is the art director of Neon Crisis.

**How she joined**:
- found out about NC from her brother
- checked out the project and fell in love
- wanted to contribute

**About her**:
- she has been drawing anime since childhood
- after her father showed her anime for the first time, she fell in love

NC Team will make an official announcement soon.

## Battle contracts

Updates from [Cicada]((https://twitter.com/CicadaNCR)

- statistics got implemented a while ago
- interactions are secure
- a commit reveals a pattern
- someone will propose in a battle, and there will be an instance associated with the battle
- Equip and unequip (you can hide the way you did it)
- MVP is coming soon
- Simple rock-paper-scissors type contracts until equipable are ready

**Procedure**:
- Choose your move -> watch it -> submit your battle.
- Others can accept the pending battle.
- Reveal, and everything comes to a conclusion

**Battle contracts are a big deal. They are going to make it the best experience possible.**


**Alpha**:
Taking into account multiple metaverses and the grand vision, they are paying attention.

They want to build a brand and experience — so a lot is being talked about by many people.

This will be a lot more than just battle contracts.

# AMA Questions

## Interactions with Singular and other marketplaces. Are they staying on moonriver, or are they going to interact with other chains?

No Singular EVM marketplace is planned at the moment.

So right now, NC is only EVM. The Polkadot side is pretty big. EVM is the most secure language they are used to. But when Singular accessories come to EVM, then yes, they'll work with them.

They are looking at other metaverses that are EVM compatible—definitely looking at them. [Cicada](https://twitter.com/CicadaNCR) is spending a reasonable amount of time looking into various metaverses.

They love Moonriver but are not closing doors to other options, and they are looking at Astar.

## Yung beef's tournament telegram group, he would like to see Neon crisis on Telegram. Are they joining it?

[Kenji](https://twitter.com/CrisisKenji) is reaching out to [Yung Beef](https://twitter.com/CryptoCowboyOG) regarding the dotsama tournament and would love to contribute to it in any way they can. 

There are talks with Neon Crisis already. Moonsama's Minecraft—prize pool. They are thinking about ways to contribute more to various communities. Not everyone can afford Minecraft clients. They may sponsor some Neons and are planning participation in the tournament.

# Wrapping up

The Dotsama community is different from any other. On Binance Smart Chain, it is hard to build a good community. In the Dotsama space, there are not that many shitcoins and many quality products. NFTs are big here because the community is so strong.

It's hard to stay up to date with so many other communities launching daily, but they are driven.

In time, it will pay off.

DHG!
