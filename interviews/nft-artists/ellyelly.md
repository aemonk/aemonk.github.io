# Elly Elly

We got the chance to talk to an aspiring artist on Singular. [Elly](https://twitter.com/elwiruz) loves knitting and sewing and has a unique style in her NFTs.

She is the Creator of the ["Bedside Monsters"](https://singular.app/collections/9e42ace6713ae9334b-BOOOO?page=5). 

The first-ever fully animated generative collection consists of 500 unique generative and 25 hand-drawn secret monsters dedicated to creatures from our childhood fantasies that live under the bed, in the closet, or lurk at night in a dark corner of the room.

For all of you who are already scared, get ready; we are diving into all of our childhood fears.

## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be an artist? When did you start? 

> Hi! Thank you so much for calling me in for this interview; it's a great honor and very exciting! It all started in kindergarten when I first fell into the drawing and needlework section, and since then, art has been present in my life. 
> 
> I can't precisely say, "I always wanted to be an artist!" but I can say, "I love drawing and good design!" :) 

### What brought you to the NFT space? 

> I learned about NFTs when the first wave of hype began, but I didn't pay much attention to it. I liked the idea of a CG artist being able to verify the origins of their work through a token, and I began to follow the NFT movement. 
> 
> After a while, I accidentally stumbled across Singular and was amazed at how many amazing artists there were. 
> One of them was the creator of the Glass Dudes collection ([@daphomin](https://twitter.com/daphomin)), I wrote to him, and he told me how everything worked here and helped me put up my first collection, **Bedside Monsters**. 

### What do you wish for in the NFT space? 

> The NFT space allows me to realize my creativity without depending on anyone else while earning a little money. 
> There are also a lot of great people here! 

### How would you describe your art? Why do you think people resonate with your artworks? 

> I think my art can be described in one word: "simple". It refers to the simple but beautiful things in our lives that we have lost sight of in the digital age. 

> For example, the giveaway dedicated to memories from our childhood was adorable. 
> People wrote many personal stories and opened the door to their hearts for a second - that's worth a lot! 

### Tell me a bit of your inspiration for your art? Does anything specific spark your style? 

> I am inspired by vivid memories, beautiful things, and interesting situations in life :) I try to create something pleasant to look at without any context and try not to be attached to artistic techniques and styles. 

> For example, in parallel with Bedside Monsters, I am developing a collection in mixed technique 3D+2D, and honestly, it looks fantastic; I want to show it soon! 

### What is the story behind the "Bedside Monsters" collection? Which story do you want to tell with it? 

> Good question! 
> 
> As a child, I was terrified of the dark and tried for a long time to cope with it. I would purposely go into dark rooms and stand there in terror, covered in goosebumps, until the fear went away...brrr. 
> 
> My collection is dedicated to the monsters that a child's imagination draws at such moments. In the end, I defeated the "dark monsters" and now remember it with laughter, but vivid memories remain for life.

### What else besides art do you enjoy doing? 

> I love knitting and sewing; it relaxes me and distracts me from everyday life and work; I think soon I will share with you my knitted works:) 
> 
> Also, I like to do sports; after a good workout, there is a charge of energy for creativity. 

### What are some of your favorite pieces that you've created? 

> At the moment, it's **"Bedside Monsters"** since it's a complete work with an exciting concept, but there are a few more things I can't tell you about yet ;) 

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far? 

> Maybe I didn't quit studying the NFT space after the first wave of hype and got into the Dotsama community, hahaha. 

### Do you have any favorite artists or art pieces from the NFT community?

> Oh, that's a tricky question. There are many; I mostly follow artists within Singular; here are the guys who inspired me to create my collection. 

- [@YumiArtsNFT](https://twitter.com/YumiArtsNFT) (Kitty Paradise)
- [@daphomin](https://twitter.com/daphomin) (Glass Dudes)
- [@lizi_palkinizi](https://twitter.com/lizi_palkinizi) (Planets as girls)

- [@nftxtiff](https://twitter.com/nftxtiff) (Pixel Babes)
- [@vivarium_art](https://twitter.com/vivarium_art) (Crazy Canary) 

### Who would you like to collaborate with in the future? 

> Exactly with all those listed above, as well as with 

- [@OlaskaArt](https://twitter.com/OlaskaArt) (Chaos Masks)
- [@SFR_Studios](https://twitter.com/SFR_Studios) (Ku Shibas)
- [@ArticKusama](https://twitter.com/ArticKusama) (0xPenguins)

- etc.; this list can go on for a long time :) 

> It would also be interesting to work with the fantastic musicians from the [@Cha0sCollective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) 

### What is your vision as an artist in the NFT space? And what is it that excites you the most? 

> What worries me most is that NFT art is not backed up by physical objects and is fixated on itself. So far, people have been promised ghostly metaverses, but that doesn't inspire confidence, and I think for actual development, NFT tokens need to be woven into the real world as one. 
> 
> I think that's what the future holds, and I will be moving in that direction. 

### If you had three wishes, what would you wish for? 

> 1. I want as few people as possible to experience pain, suffering, and injustice. 
> 2. good health 
> 3. live my life in such a way that I have no regrets before I die. Probably a little gloomy, hahaha, but I think that's the main thing 

### Famous last words? 

> If you have the desire and the minimal opportunity to learn and create - learn and create!

> Many thanks for the great questions and for the opportunity to talk about myself and my collection. It was fascinating ❤️
