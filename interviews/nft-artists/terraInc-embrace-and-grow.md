# Terra Incognita - Embrace & Grow

Today, we look at Terra Incognitas' latest collection, "**Embrace & Grow**".

[Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK) creates audio tracks with a driven percussive beat. At times the drums have an almost tribal feel that provides a natural counterpart to electronic synth melodies and sequences.

**BTW**
Snafu, a track from his last [EP](https://singular.app/collections/dcb79cfb39f4c6472f-TERRA%20INC%20002), was played at "[The Kusamarian](https://youtu.be/b6L8mBjK9Vc?t=359)" show.

[Embrace and Grow](https://singular.app/collections/dcb79cfb39f4c6472f-TERRA%20INC%20002) is the second release for [Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK) on his label "Terra Inc", following on from the debut [Interface Meta](https://singular.app/collections/dcb79cfb39f4c6472f-TERRA%20INC%20001). 

In the words of the artist himself 
> "it is an EP that represents the process of reaching into the unknown to grasp and accomplish what we truly desire sonically and musically. In the case of this project, it was those rhythms and textures that lie out in the vast unknown, waiting to be gathered to create the music I dream within my mind and feel in my soul. It is important to be patient and embrace the process required to be able to understand and create what we desire, that is how we grow and develop as artists and human beings." 

The [EP](https://singular.app/collections/dcb79cfb39f4c6472f-TERRA%20INC%20002) contains four tracks with a bonus track that will only be available for buyers of the NFT release on RMRK Singular and when the whole EP gets purchased on [Bandcamp](https://terraincuk.bandcamp.com/).

This release is a step forward from where the [debut](https://singular.app/collections/dcb79cfb39f4c6472f-TERRA%20INC%20001) left off, experimenting with new sounds, textures, and rhythms. 


_Below is a brief breakdown of each track._

### Willful Delusion
**Willful Delusion** opens the EP with a slightly detuned looping melody, constantly modulating over the top of rolling drum rhythms. Uptempo head music for a time when a room has not quite peaked yet.

### Relics of Another Time
**Relics of Another Time** features hypnotic loop-based rhythms with crackling textures, sitting within the more functional side of the techno spectrum. This track's driving rhythm places it more within the peak time groove. 

### Snafu
**Snafu** takes on a slightly slower tempo than the previous two, leaning on ambient textured pads and a repeated vocal stab that treads the fine line between techno and uptempo House music. This almost raises a feeling of nostalgia and euphoria.

### Timing is Unquantifiable
The final track **Timing is Unquantifiable** returns to a more groove-based hypnotic rhythm section, manipulating squelching filters and resonances to create an almost unsettling atmosphere for the listener's mind. 

### Ghosts in the Narrative (Bonus)
Ghosts in the Narrative is the bonus track only available on the [NFT](https://singular.app/collections/dcb79cfb39f4c6472f-TERRA%20INC%20002), and [Bandcamp](https://terraincuk.bandcamp.com/) (full release on Bandcamp May 6th) releases. 
It features broken rhythms with hypnotic groove-like textures that weave their way around the percussive hits. Borrowing from more ambient and dubby styles, this track gives a feel of building something rather than destroying it.



_I hope this collection resonates with you too._
