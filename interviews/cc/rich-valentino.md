## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be a musician? When did you start pursuing a career in music?

> I always wanted to be a musician! Music has been with me since I was a kid. I've been making music since 2011 and continue to do so to this day. I think it's with me for the rest of my life =\)

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> My father showed me [singular](https://singular.app/), and I decided to show people my music here!

### How would you describe your sound? Why do you think people resonate with your music?

> My sound is the flow of the dreamer; that is me. I think everyone can find a piece of himself in my music and feel the vibe of the track he found.

### Where do you find your inspiration?

> Music and people inspire me.
> I listen to a lot of different music. It can be classical music as well as weird and unusual electronic music. Everything around me and my environment inspire me.

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics?

> I think that every musician finds what he likes! Many people improve their sound and musical taste over time and find a sound, a track, a rhythm that they like better. I feel it, and that's all, I can't explain it.
> I recognize it right away when I start shaking my head and imagining the picture.

### Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that no one would expect.

> I am an Engineer and Chef. =D

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> My accomplishments are not that great! But I'm proud of the music I'm writing now. By the way, I have one [track on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/richvalentinobeat/feel-that-w-xcidrxnger) with 14k listens; I guess I can be proud of that?

### What is your story about chaos collective? How did you join? What was the process of working together?

> One day I found [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL), [Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK), and [Leifwyn](https://twitter.com/leifwyn) on Twitter and started chatting on Telegram, and then we got together as [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective). I'm damn lucky to be on the team. Every person on our team is unique, with exceptional sounds! I'm proud of them \<3

### Which track did you choose for the album and why?

> I chose the track "cry"! We wanted to write a lo-fi album, and I chose this track because it conveyed my state of mind when we put together the [Chaos Collective Album 1](https://singular.app/collections/de5813cb17b1cf1a0e-CHA0S).

### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> Probably a lot of people! Definitely on that list are [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL), [Bowser Staxx](https://twitter.com/BowserStaxx), [harunoheart](https://twitter.com/harunoheart), [Leifwyn](https://twitter.com/leifwyn), and a few other people who make music. On top of that, I'd like to collaborate with 3d artists, but I can't decide who yet.

### What are your goals for this year? Any Alpha to share?

> This year, I will make a lot of solo music and music with the [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective)! I think I will not reveal plans yet. There's a lot of good music this year, friends, wait for it.
