After the great success of the first multi-resource collaborative music NFT [Album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU), we had the opportunity to get to know the artists behind it a little better.

Therefore we present the [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) interview spotlight series.

## Chaos Collective

## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be a musician? When did you start pursuing a career in music?

> I wanted to be a musician as soon as I picked up an electric guitar up when I was 13 years old. Playing around in my bedroom with 4 track tape machines and delay pedals while getting stoned was heaven to me. I have subsequently been signed to labels, toured Europe and America, worked in recording studios as a producer and for the last 10 years or so made music for film and television.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> Through film composing. I worked on a 4 part broadcast documentary about Bitcoin / Blockchain in 2018. I then worked with the same director on some films for Polkadot. I was asked to provide music for the [Sub0 conference](https://sub0.substrate.io/) last year and I brought my good friend on board – [Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK). We put together two hours of original music and afterwards minted the soundtracks as [limited NFTs](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/5e18f2acddf1f3951e-50CGI). At that point the only other musician on Singular was [fr.om](https://twitter.com/MycolNepetrov). We were really welcomed and supported by the community and sold those NFTs. After that I just got drawn into the space. I'm excited about the possibilities offered to all creatives but musicians in particular.

### How would you describe your sound? Why do you think people resonate with your music?

> It's based around texture and the tension between new technology / computer based processes and organic sounds from instruments or even nature. Using more traditional terms to describe then it probably falls into the categories of Ambient / Minimalism / Post Classical / Experimental.

> I'm not sure why people connect. I hope it's because the music gives them a space to inhabit that allows for reflection, memories, dreams or just drifting.

### Where do you find your inspiration?

> Lots of places.
>
> Music-wise I love artists like [Ryuichi Sakamoto](https://twitter.com/ryuichisakamoto), [Steve Reich](https://twitter.com/SteveReich), [Godspeed You Black Emporer](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/), [Tim Hecker](https://twitter.com/tim_hecker), [Cocteau Twins](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCle3lHYlHgugefCCr78N1Gw).

> I also take inspiration from books, nature, film soundtracks.

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics?

> You don't, but you do look for a response in yourself. It's difficult to describe but you need to dig around in the dirt, you also need to make bad art sometimes. The good stuff kind of becomes alive and takes on its own life. It's clear on some pieces of music when this happens but for other tracks you need feedback from people you respect. I play Terra a lot of my music and he is a great platform for ideas. This is why I like to collaborate, if two or more people really vibe on a piece then you know you are on to something.

### Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that no one would expect.

> I only hold Cardano...(_**joking**_).

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> I recently scored a [David Attenborough](https://twitter.com/AttenboroughSir) documentary for the BBC.

### What is your story about chaos collective?

> I think it kinda just started with a twitter thread, someone suggested doing a collab ep. It just unfolded organically but [iamyou](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL) and [bowser staxx](https://twitter.com/BowserStaxx) definitely brought extra energy that helped turn it into something bigger. It makes sense that a group of musicians from different parts of the globe, all interested in doing things a bit differently, have come together under one umbrella to support and progress what each other is doing.

### Which track did you choose for the album and why?

> I wrote a track called "Cirrus" for this [album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU). The basic / initial concept was lofi so I played around with degradation and tape processing. I also loved the idea of "Cirrus" clouds as a precursor to changes in the weather. I felt that their unique shapes had a relationship to the way I like to process sound – in this case a piano performance.

### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> I am open to collaboration with lots of people. I would really like to find a like-minded visual artist that shares a similar aesthetic to me so I can delve deeper into audio/visual artforms.

### What are your goals for this year? Any Alpha to share?

> [Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK) and I are planning a new concept album. There will be more [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) releases. I will also be developing and minting more Binaural work – the first of which will be shown on the [Dotsama Experience gallery](https://twitter.com/TheDotSamaEXPC).

### Famous last words?

> You have to die a few times before you can really live. (Bukowski)
