After the great success of the first multi-resource collaborative music NFT [Album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU), we had the opportunity to get to know the artists behind it a little better.

Therefore we present the [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) interview spotlight series.

## Chaos Collective

The biggest news came in the last few days; the collective of 9 music NFT artists presented us with the FIRST multi-resource [Music NFT Album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU) on [Singular 2.0](https://singular.app/).
If you haven't heard of them, they are called [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective), and their collaboration album is named [Chaos Collective Album 1](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU).
Do you want to know more about the album? Check out this [summary](https://app.subsocial.network/5905/the-chaos-we-need-chaos-collective-album-31860).

After all that, we got the chance to ask them a few questions.

## Terra Incognita

We chatted with this emerging music NFT producer and found some interesting facts about him. 

The collaborative album from the [Chaos Collective](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU) effortlessly marks the artist's significance and place in the NFT space.

## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be a musician? When did you start pursuing a career in music?

> I have always been involved with music. I started to DJ when I was about 13 years old; that was 1997. I then moved towards songwriting and was part of 2 different bands. In my late 20s, I moved back towards electronic music production, focusing on Techno, House, and Ambient music. I have always wanted to create and perform music in some sort of capacity more than anything else in life. It is something I will never be able to leave behind or stop doing.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> I really fell into this space by accident at first. My good friend [Leif Wyn](https://twitter.com/leifwyn) and I were approached about doing the music for the [sub0](https://twitter.com/substrate_io) conference last year. That music was received extremely well at the event. Off the back of it we learned a little about the potential of NFTs, minted the mixes and [dropped them](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/5e18f2acddf1f3951e-50CGI) on Singular. The rest is history really. Around the same time we immersed ourselves in the Dotsama and NFT community on Twitter and started to interact with many like minded individuals, that is how we found the rest of the folks within the collective.

### How would you describe your sound? Why do you think people resonate with your music?

> The music I am making at this point in time is pretty hypnotic and rhythmical. I am obsessed with rhythm and texture. The overall sound and aesthetic of the music is as important to me as the actual arrangement of the song. I am very passionate about sound in general. I try to create interesting textures and rhythms that on the first listen can seem a little repetitive but on a deeper level are actually always shifting and modulating, playing with the listener's mind. Most of it is also made with the dance floor in mind and to fit within the context of a DJ set.

> I also have another side to my output which focuses more on ambient soundscape and textures which provoke emotions rather than make the listener move rhythmically. I have not released any of that side of my output on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/HZibaM8AKBwK4pPhLvi8HkK2mfTpv9rsZxQvoPbUGB1UCTB) as yet but I aim to in the near future.

### Where do you find your inspiration?

> I find my inspiration mostly in listening to other music. Finding sounds and rhythms that inspire me and make me instantly want to dive into [Ableton](https://twitter.com/Ableton) and hook up a midi controller. I also find great inspiration from listening to podcasts. This could be hearing other artists and creatives talking about their processes or topics including spirituality and philosophy. I am a very spiritual being and I feel that plays a big role in inspiring my process.

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics?

> In the moment of creation I feel bliss. Total and absolute connection and oneness with the process on a good day. I am not someone who can hear something in my head then go and create it, I need to go out and find the sounds and the ideas then enter a dialogue. I feel inspiration from what is in front of me and react to that so I feel like the process is in collaboration with whatever the idea is. I know I am on the right track when I feel like I am in a two way dialogue with the idea and it is touching my inner being.

### Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that no one would expect.

> I am a Music Technology Lecturer but I am originally a Welder to trade.

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> Recently one of my favourite electronic music producers heard my new EP and told me he thought the tracks were amazing. That meant more to me than everything I have earned financially in music in my life.

### What is your story about chaos collective?

> Everything moves so fast in this space that it always just seems like a blur. From what I remember we created a group chat on Telegram, that became the idea of a [collaborative album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU), which then grew into the idea of a [collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective). This formed officially as that and we brought together the album. The thing really grew quickly and exponentially and has been even far more of a success so far than anyone imagined. We have some other cool opportunities and ideas in the pipeline and I think it is important we don't sleep on them and just keep building and refining the quality of what we do. It is early days within this community and we are still laying foundations, it is great to have brought together such an open minded, supportive and passionate bunch of artists.

### Which track did you choose for the album and why?

> I chose to put **Kusama on Acid** for the album. [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL) had originally suggested the idea of doing a lofi theme so I set about creating something with a really dark warehouse vibe, lots of reverb and hiss. It was originally about 10 BPM faster but once I discovered the idea of putting an acid line over the drum rhythm I knew I needed to slow the groove. The result was something closer to acid house. The name is a play on _Pacha on Acid_ by [Afrojack](https://twitter.com/afrojack), a track I loved many years back.


### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> Within the NFT community I have always been a really big fan of the glitch style gif artworks. I love [JakNFT](https://twitter.com/JakNFT) and [Manicâ€™s](https://twitter.com/manicdistopia) stuff. I would love to do a colab with either of them. I feel the Metatech sound I could would work really well with that style of art. In the real world my all time ambition for a collaboration would be with [Kanye](https://twitter.com/kanyewest). I believe the process would be mind bending.

### What are your goals for this year? Any Alpha to share?

> To develop further as an artist in general. To create a larger collection of work that I self release on Singular. To straddle the NFT world with the traditional industry. Make more friends in both. Grow my own record label, release on a record label I respect out with my own. To get out and DJ more in the real world and also do some metaverse/VR style sets too. To get some other work out with the Chaos Collective crew and bring more talented musicians into the RMRK Dotsama Community.

### Famous last words?

> Dream big, stay humble
