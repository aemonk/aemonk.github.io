## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be a musician? When did you start pursuing a career in Music?

> I've done music in some sort for essentially my entire life - from being a young kiddo playing around with toy instruments to torturing myself to learn guitar. I started messing around with DAW's when I was around 14 and haven't really looked back.
> I didn't really think I would be able to pursue a career in music, as it's quite a toxic work environment and not very artist friendly. Just didn't want to deal with all of that so I never really made an effort to release my music for monetary gain until recently.
> NFT's have definitely changed how I view working in music as a career. Is it going to last forever? I honestly do not know, but I do know that people ended up liking what I have to say with my music. And that's worth more to me than any amount of gold/money.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> [@YungBeef](https://twitter.com/CryptoCowboyOG) 100% - if weren't for him, I probably would never have even looked. Honestly, I was sick of hearing him talk about them! But I do really appreciate him for making me take the dive into the space. He gave me an ultimatum I couldn't quite turn down.

### How would you describe your sound? Why do you think people resonate with your Music?

> Psychedelic, genreless, and atmosphereic. Especially my more recent music, a lot of which is unreleased as of right now. I'm quite a fan of "painting" a picture with sound, as in creating moods and feelings that surround my music. I think this is why people are able to resonate with me. I've realized long ago that music is an extension of our emotions and ultimately it is that which makes us who we are.

### Where do you find your inspiration?

> I draw inspiration from quite a few sources to be completely honest. Psychedelic experiences are a primary motivator in my more recent music, but ultimately all of my music boils down to how I feel when I create the initial bars that turn into a song.
> Other musicians are also a huge motivation for me. Hearing what others have accomplished only inspires me to do it better.

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics?

> You just "know".
> It might fit the vibe of what you are doing, it might give you goose bumps, or it might just make you go "yeah.." and bob your head a bit. This is what it's all about really, creating and vibing in the moment.

### Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that no one would expect.

> I keep tarantulas ;)

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> Honestly, right now? Chaos Collective. I am significantly proud of what we've accomplished so far. I cannot believe I was a major player in bringing everyone together and forming something as wonderful as we ended up doing. I think our first album was a significant success and I just know it is an amazing start to something bigger than all of us involved.
> Another thing that just blows me away is the amount of people who have reached out to me for advice or thanking me for inspiring them in their own efforts. I just cannot believe it sometimes. Life has truly given me something to be thankful for. I never saw myself in this position!

### What is your story about chaos collective? How did you join? What was the process of working together?

> I am one of the founder members, I guess you could say _the_ founder but I won't really take credit for that. [CC](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) was a group effort spear-headed by my literal laziness with producing an entire album. If it weren't for everyone involved, it would not of happened. So I can't take credit. I will say though that I am sort of a significant voice in the Collective and quite possibly the leader. It feels weird to label myself such things as this is all so new to me. But for now, I am rolling with it!
> I am just blessed to be involved in any way.

### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> I have a lot on my plate at the moment, a lot of missed oppurtunities and friendships have resulted from this. So right now I am working on finishing what I need to finish before I really start to go out of my way with more collaborations. With that being said though, I am always looking and planning ahead. ;)

### What are your goals for this year? Any Alpha to share?

> Well, my goal of 2021 was to make it my best year yet for my music. I smashed that goal out of the park.
> 2022 is much of the same, except this year I am building something spectacular, something I could of never envisioned myself.
> Let's just say some _**big**_ players are looking our way right now.

### Famous last words?

> Realize what your dreams are and Actualize on them.
> Manifest them into your reality and force them into existence.

**IAMYOU**
