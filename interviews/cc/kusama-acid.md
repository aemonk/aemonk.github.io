## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be a musician? When did you start pursuing a career in music?

> Actually, since I was 16, I have always listened to a lot of music, also many different genres, and I started experimenting with turntables through my brother. I still remember when I managed to put two pieces of vinyl in time for the first time, that feeling I will never forget.

> I learned self-taught how to play the guitar and program synths. I learned by myself by meeting friends who had these machines, trying and trying again.

> I started with Ableton around 18; I didn't have much gear and instruments, just a few. Over the years of working, I managed to buy my first synths as Elektron analog four (it was the first, and I will struggle to get rid of it ❤️), Jp 8000, Elektron digitone, and many others.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> Let's say that, to be honest, I have been in this crypto world not for long, exactly February of last year. Last summer, as a joke, a friend of mine showed me Singular, and he said to me, try to experience your art and your music here, and so it was. Even as a joke, I must say that this choice is giving me so much satisfaction that maybe outside of this world, I have not found it yet.

### How would you describe your sound? Why do you think people resonate with your music?

> Difficult question, haha; I believe that my sound is genuine; I take a lot of inspiration from external artists, but I think it is correct, but what I do, I do it with the heart. I try to convey the emotions that my music gives to me to others who listen to it.

### Where do you find your inspiration?

> There are many artists that I follow, every year, I change my taste a little; I think it's also a positive thing, I'm the kind of artist that monotony bores on me, and I'm always looking around for new vibes.

> I followed and I follow: 
> [Moderat](https://twitter.com/moderatofficial), 
> [Thom Yorke](https://twitter.com/thomyorke), 
> [Skee Mask](https://twitter.com/sk33mask), 
> [Burial](https://twitter.com/burialuk), 
> [Aphex Twin](https://twitter.com/aphextwin)
> and many more.

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics?

> When I can picture myself with my eyes closed, it makes me travel. We are at a good point if I have goosebumps, and I can finalize it. 🎵

> A loop often fails to become a whole track; what I try to do is to leave it aside and start something else; let's say that it is a piece of advice that I give to everyone.

### Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that no one would expect.

> Oh, well. If I don't have constant stimulation in art and music, I feel bad. ⛔️

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> In terms of music? 
> 
> Well, over the years, before entering the NFT's world, I played a lot around Italy, m that I got a lot of satisfaction as a DJ, now I want to take them off as a producer. One of the greatest satisfactions is receiving almost continuous feedback on my art and the music I produce, which gives me the power of strength. 🙏

### What is your story about chaos collective?

> It started like that, [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL) and I followed each other. Through [MOON-Bearer](https://twitter.com/tsallGoodmann), I saw that the label had already started and reached out to [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL), and he welcomed me like a brother.
> 
> A colab remix of CRY from [Rich Valentino](https://twitter.com/Rich_Valentinoo) is coming, the single released recently on the first multi-resource collaboration [album](https://singular.app/collections/de5813cb17b1cf1a0e-CHA0S) of the [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective)!

### With which artists were you already able to make collaborations? What impressed you the most?

> As a producer with [Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK), and [Leif Wyn](https://twitter.com/leifwyn), while with my [Acid Pills collection](https://singular.app/collections/7e34eeb5e6bc90bd63-%20%20%20%E2%9D%82%E2%80%BF%E2%9D%82) I have already collaborated with [Kusama Dragons](https://twitter.com/KusamaDragons), [Luigi Lucarelli](https://twitter.com/LuigiL1985) with his [Rubble Punkz](https://twitter.com/Rubble_Punkz) and [Yumi ARTS](https://twitter.com/YumiArtsNFT)! 

### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> At the moment, with nobody, I remixed [Rich Valentino](https://twitter.com/Rich_Valentinoo), but I count on being able to work with [Terra Incognita](https://twitter.com/TerraIncUK) too, he is a great lover of techno, and I think we could get along! 💪🏻
> Actually, what I'd like to do is to be able to collaborate with artists and musicians from other platforms; I think that would be great!

### What are your goals for this year?

> Honestly, it's being able to finish this collection in the best possible way, and concentrate and start my third collection, then;
> I would like to make an album with the Chaos Collective!

### Any Alpha to share?

> Currently, I'm working with another artist in the Dotsama ecosystem; you will see something big In the coming weeks.

> Just a little clue… 👑👀🔥

### Famous last words?

> 💊 "An Acid Pill will be forever" 💊
