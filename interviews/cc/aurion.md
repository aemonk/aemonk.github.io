## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be a musician? When did you start pursuing a career in music?

> I wanted to be a musician from around the age of 13, I think. I pursued that all the way till I was around 19 or so, when I shifted goals and became a coder.
> I'll get back into music more eventually when I can afford to pimp out my studio completely.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> Just being involved in the crypto space in general, really. It was a natural progression.

### How would you describe your sound? Why do you think people resonate with your music?

> I tend towards the melodic. Maybe it's not super apparent in my released music, but I love to take an idea and make it as epic as possible by adding a choir and string ensemble behind it. The power of modern music software is truly incredible. I also love to combine my guitar background with my general electronic music skills to create a unique combo you don't hear much of.

### Where do you find your inspiration?

> The joy of life just inspires me, I guess. Music is beautiful, and I don't know what I would do without it.

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics?

> When I get a big smile on my face and find myself listening to it over and over again while pacing back and forth, lol.

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> My most significant achievement as Artist is the Chaos Collectie Album.

### What is your story about chaos collective?

> Personal friends with [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL). [Chaos Collective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) is an external force trying to pull me back into making music.

### Which track did you choose for the album and why?

> I put a chill hip hop-type beat called "Back In The Day" on the record. I actually made this track a long time ago, but nothing else was happening with it, and it fit the vibe of the album concept.

### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> First, I gotta start making music myself again.

### What are your goals for this year? Any Alpha to share?

> It would be cool to start making some music again this year, but my main goal is to get a rust/[substrate](https://twitter.com/substrate_io) developer position in the dotsama ecosystem. That's what I'm studying for right now.

### Famous last words?

> "Peace amidst Chaos" - me
