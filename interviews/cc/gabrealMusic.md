## Interview



### Have you always wanted to be a musician? 

> I've played piano for more than eight years and electric guitar for four years. I didn't start with the intention to be a musician one day; it was more like getting started, enjoying playing, and looking deeper into it with Digital Audio Workstations later on. Once you get to know the right people, it carries you on to the next steps; naturally, I would say. 

### When did you start pursuing a career in music? 

> I started learning the piano when I was five years old, then later I started playing the electric guitar, as mentioned above. In 2018 I started to play around with [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) and later [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). I'm a big [David Guetta](https://twitter.com/davidguetta) and [Avicii](https://twitter.com/avicii) fan â€“ so I found my way to [FL Studio](https://twitter.com/FL_Studio) and later [Ableton](https://twitter.com/Ableton). 
> 
> I took recording lessons on- and offline to learn a bit about the tech and anatomy of song making and sampling. I am still learning every day. In 2018 I started composing my own melodies and tracks, and in 2019 I released three tracks on [streaming platforms](https://open.spotify.com/artist/52ht0XbCGxM0pabCEDkUVg?si=mCq7e5HGRUWDAwLp9eeqjw&nd=1). 
> This caught the attention of local media, and I had to give an interview in newspaper, radio, and even on TV ðŸ˜³ .
> One of my [songs](https://open.spotify.com/track/6mFk8UX3dcsUZ7MsJwvZWq?si=218c94932ec64291) was played several times on the radio ðŸ˜….
> 
> It was really fun, and I enjoyed working together with other, grown-up real musicians, which I learned a lot from. Unfortunately, it all stopped suddenly in March 2020, when the world as we knew it stopped existing due to this pandemic.
> I continued creating music on my own, and my lessons went into online platforms like Discord (surprisingly, this works amazingly well). In the meantime, my [dad](https://twitter.com/ape_hodling) was doing stuff with NFTs, and so I got in touch with [Bowser Staxx](https://twitter.com/BowserStaxx), who motivated us to mint some of my tracks on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/FFRQo9xsJ2MZPZRWqU26MauJg4HEj9Am99FBzRRvgsmxpsA?page=1&tab=created&creator=true&showCollections=yes). 

### Since when are you in the NFT space? 

> Since 2021, my [dad](https://twitter.com/ape_hodling) showed me some stuff over time ðŸ˜Š  
> For example like [ChaosDAO](https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) Apes, [Kanaria](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp) but as well [Moonsama](https://twitter.com/MoonsamaNFT). I'm a huge [Minecraft](https://twitter.com/Minecraft) fan and have been running my server for a long time.

### What brought you to the Music NFT space?

> I was inspired by what [IAMYOU](https://twitter.com/IAMYOUOFFICIAL), [Bowser Staxx](https://twitter.com/BowserStaxx), [fr.om](https://twitter.com/MycolNepetrov) were doing and it was mainly Bowser Staxx motivating me just to do this ðŸ˜Š (and his super cool [Birb Tape collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/cc89eac7f82ae14164-8IR8T4P35V2SRS)). 

### How would you describe your sound? 

> EDMish-LoFi-Synthwave crossover maybe ðŸ˜‚  but I realize it is changing as I get older and learn new skills. I'm far away from being a real musician yet. For example, this is "Oriental Bass" on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/764ae05560a879752a-Z2PP2).

### Why do you think people resonate with your music? 

> Good question; I'm trying to catch a vibe and put it into a flow. 

### Where do you find your inspiration? 

> Listening to stuff all day and getting melodies and ideas all about the place. Mood, situation, literally everything can be an inspiration for a sound. 

### How do you know when you've found a perfect beat/track/song/lyrics? 

> If I like it in the end, it's good ðŸ˜Š  
> No, seriously, there's no such thing as THE perfect track, but eventually, you reach a point where you think: 
> This works! And it contains the vibes and the flow. 

### Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that no one would expect. 

> I don't know, other than that, I'm currently 13ys old â€“ I'm a regular guy ðŸ˜Š 

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> When speaking about music, it was part of this world premiere with [ChaosCollective](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective)! 
> 
> Just starting to understand what just happened. It was the first-ever [Music Album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU?page=1&tab=created&creator=true) as stackable, modular NFTs. Truly an honor! I love the other guys and their spirit â€“ they're all so supportive! 

### What is your story about chaos collective? 

> [Bowser Staxx](https://twitter.com/BowserStaxx) got in touch and asked if I might want to join after I had released my first [two collections](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/FFRQo9xsJ2MZPZRWqU26MauJg4HEj9Am99FBzRRvgsmxpsA?page=1&tab=created&creator=true&showCollections=yes).

### Which track did you choose for the album and why? 

> I chose a piece with a saxophone because it has such a relaxing effect (I think) â€“ I wanted to create a sound that you could just enjoy listening to while hanging around doing nothing ðŸ˜Š
> 
> It's even called "Chillin my way" and Track 7 on that EP ðŸ˜‰ 

### Who else would you like to collaborate with in the future? 

> I'm doing another collab right now with a musician IRL, but other than that, I'm open for any kind of stuff, because I really enjoy the process of being part of something bigger than me ðŸ˜Š

### What are your goals for this year? 

> Surviving school would be my top item ðŸ˜‚ 

### Any Alpha to share?

> Currently working on an NFT workshop (in real life) together with my [dad](https://twitter.com/ape_hodling), where we want to educate musicians and artists on possibilities in the NFT space â€“ He's a missionary for the DotSama ecosystem. The [CC album](https://singular.app/space/HbrK5uFZrnmFL4LWB2YAVWiB9MPwfV5zEFiyX3efFd7R6hU?page=1&tab=created&creator=true) will be the best example for this you can imagine ðŸ˜‰ 
> 
> And during this workshop I'm going to mint a new track, which was a collab with another musician (which is quite known in my area) where he's playing the trumpet. It shall be a charity one, where we want to donate the proceeds to refugees. I can't wait for this, tbh ðŸ˜Š 
> 
> I am so proud and happy to know the [CC guys](https://twitter.com/Cha0sCollective) and being part of this exclusive club. 

### Famous last words? 

> I'll be back. ðŸ˜‚
