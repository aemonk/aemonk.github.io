## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be an artist? When did you start?

> Yes, since childhood, I have been drawing a lot and dreamed of becoming an artist. But there was a time when I did not draw for a very long time and did not know what I wanted. So consciously, I came to this only a few years ago.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> I think that it is a desire to show my vision of NFT pictures. I would even say contemporary art, something that was not there before, something new and inspiring. This is what the future is, and I want to be a part of it.

### What do you wish for in the NFT space?

> Identity, freedom of expression, and continuous development of artists and community.

### How would you describe the Hyper Club?

> [Hyper club](https://twitter.com/Hyper_Club_nft) is a community of incredibly talented, extraordinary, and incredible people. It does its own thing but never refuses to help a friend.
> The hyper club is a family that will guide, prompt, helpful, and embody everything we go into real life. I think it will be an exciting story.

### How would you describe your art? Why do you think people resonate with your artworks?

> To be honest, it's challenging to find a word or expression. But I would venture to say that my art is about the fact that we are all people worldwide. It doesn't matter your nationality; the main thing is what kind of person you are. It would be best if you were exemplary not only in words but also in deeds.
> I think that my vision of this world is close to theirs; I think that the theme of the world's countries is very interesting and colorful in its own way. We have so many countries, and there are so many beautiful things in each, perhaps in the aggregate, all this responded in my works.

### Tell me a bit of your inspiration for your art? Does anything specific spark your style?

> Anything can inspire me. It can be people, pictures, films, music, and everything in this world is capable of it. Sometimes I listen to music, and under some tracks, a surge begins in my head, which leads to a stream of fantasies, and at this moment, the main thing is not to miss this thread and fix it. Sometimes in transport, I look out the window, and in my thoughts, looking at the city, I start to come up with something.

### What is the story behind the "BOUNDLESS MOTHER"? Which story do you want to tell with it?

> Behind the "[boundless mother](https://singular.app/collections/566edc7dbb613f2d6b-BOUNDLESS_MOTHER)" collection are the relationships between people and countries. Regardless of the nesting doll, no matter what country it belongs to, it will always bring good luck to its owner. The name, I think, already speaks a little about the meaning of this collection: _"boundless mother"_, about the fact that there are no boundaries; in reality, in life, one must be responsive and good, isn't this the most crucial success in life?
> Matryoshka personifies all strength, power, and unity.

### What else besides art do you enjoy doing?

> In my spare time I listen to a lot of music, sometimes play guitar and love to do different handicrafts. Also, I like to make cosplays on different characters and do unusual makeup and photos. I watch many films of different genres, I am interested in fashion, and sometimes I get stuck in my mind in the 70s-90s. I am very close to the music, cinematography, and art in general of those times. One of my favorite things to do, as far as possible, is to travel.

### What are some of your favorite pieces that you've created?

> In general, I like my workâ€”something less, something more. But I think from my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TSaturna), you can see that I draw in Asian themes more often. Asian culture is very close to me; I like to delve into it and depict it in my works. So far, from the published NFTs, I have a [matryoshka](https://singular.app/collections/566edc7dbb613f2d6b-BOUNDLESS_MOTHER) doll from China - I really like it. I hope in the future I will work more on this topic to show my vision and allow you to understand me as an artist better.

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> Perhaps, at the moment, this is the fact that I was not afraid to plunge into the world of NFT and start developing in a new, completely unfamiliar area for me and already have some kind of audience that supports me and is interested in my work.

### Do you have any favorite artists or art pieces from the NFT community?

> I think so; I like the work of [@SurrealReality6](https://twitter.com/SurrealReality6), [@mitch3ll\_\_\_](https://twitter.com/mitch3ll___), [@vierlera](https://twitter.com/vierlera), [@lizi_palkinizi](https://twitter.com/lizi_palkinizi) in fact, it's not a complete list.
> In the open spaces of NFT, there are many worthy artists and works.

### Who would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> Hmm, probably with [@lizi_palkinizi](https://twitter.com/lizi_palkinizi); I like her work and think she is close to me.
> I would also really like to work with the musicians to make a collaborative animation/clip.
> And, of course, with a 3D artist to create something significant and influential.

### What is your vision as an artist in the NFT space? And what is it that excites you the most?

> It seems to me that the NFT community should be more open to new artists. The community must promote common interests, namely the development of art and artists' personalities.

### If you had three wishes, what would you wish for?

> Oh, this is an exciting question. If I had absolutely any three wishes:
> The first wish that comes to mind is that relatives and friends never get sick and be happy.
> My second wish would be for peace and unity in the world.
> And my third wish would be that I find acceptance and success in the NFT community and beyond.

### Famous last words?

> This question unlocked the song from My Chemical Romance, "Famous last words" in my memory, and I want to leave an excerpt from the text as an answer to this question:
> _"I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone"_
