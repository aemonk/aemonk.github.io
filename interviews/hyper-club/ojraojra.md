## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be an artist? When did you start?

> I always wanted to be an artist, and this is where I can realize my dream

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> [Rich](https://twitter.com/Rich_Valentinoo) called me. I was interested in the community and the possibility of my development and my dreams.

### What do you wish for in the NFT space?

> I would like to see friendly people willing to help and prompt at any time, day or night.

### How would you describe the Hyper Club?

> We are friends. I see no need to add more.

### How would you describe your art? Why do you think people resonate with your artworks?

> My work is sad, oppressive, and creepy. In life, I am a funny person. I need to share my sadness, which I share in my works.

### Tell me a bit of your inspiration for your art? Does anything specific spark your style?

> I am inspired by my fears, what I was or am still afraid of

### What is the story behind the "HUMAN FEARS"? Which story do you want to tell with it?

> Oh, it's simple, **human fears** are human fears. I want to make the point that people can fight their fears, look them in the eye, and conquer them.

### What else besides art do you enjoy doing?

> I like to drink beer and play computer games.

### What are some of your favorite pieces that you've created?

> My favorite work is the [fear of the monster under the bed](https://singular.app/collectibles/12065249-d29f3ce17c3bbdc272-HUMAN_FEARS-FEAR_OF_THE_MONSTER_UNDER_THE_BED-00000006); it's still relevant to me

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> The organizers of the [club](https://twitter.com/Hyper_Club_nft) called me; I think it's an achievement

### Do you have any favorite artists or art pieces from the NFT community?

> Maybe it's not right to admire a comrade's work so much, but I love [Rory's](https://twitter.com/Rory_Hyper) work and adore her style. I also adore our musicians, [Rich](https://twitter.com/Rich_Valentinoo) and [Haruno](https://twitter.com/harunoheart); their music puts me in the right mood for creativity.

### Who would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> I would like to work with musicians who write music in the 8-bit style; I think our styles would create a perfect pixel collaboration.

### What is your vision as an artist in the NFT space? And what is it that excites you the most?

> The NFT space is not yet at the level it could be, which is very sad.

### If you had three wishes, what would you wish for?

> Good luck

### Famous last words?

> The legendary phrase?
> How about a beer when I see you?
