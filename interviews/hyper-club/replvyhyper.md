# Hyper Club Spotlight - Replay

Today we want to introduce to you  [Replay](https://twitter.com/replvyhyper), an artist from the [Hyper Club](https://twitter.com/Hyper_Club_nft).

[Replay](https://twitter.com/replvyhyper) used to work for a bank, now he hates them. He is now completely immersed in [Blender](https://twitter.com/BlenderStudio_), making NFTs, and has a passion for music!

He made his first video on a Siemens C65 and edited it in Sony Vegas. He was nine years old at that time. The actors were schoolmates, and they were shooting an action movie with incredible special effects.

He started his career as a motion designer three years ago, and the 3D world has completely taken him over. 
Also, Replay has an academic background in piano, and yes, he wrote the music himself, which is featured in his new collection [Party Beasts](https://singular.app/collections/e84348ac164e80af0e-PARTYBEASTS), released on 17.03.2022.

## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be an artist? When did you start?

> My first attempts to create something started when I was eight and got my first pen tablet, but shortly I found out that I suck at drawing. At 9, my parents sent me to music school, but there was no freedom and creation. With my classmates, I filmed "blockbusters" on my Siemens phone and edited them, and when the internet and online games came into my life, I filmed "movies" in [GTSan Andreas](https://twitter.com/RockstarGames) (sometimes I watch it and cringe a lot). So, to sum up, since my childhood, I have wanted to create something, and now I can combine all my skills (or lack of it): draw, film, edit and make music in my artworks. Professionally I started my artistic journey as a freelance designer three years ago, but freelance doesn't give me the freedom that I need as an artist.

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> Basically, [Rich](https://twitter.com/Rich_Valentinoo) called and invited me to [HyperClub](https://twitter.com/Hyper_Club_nft), and I said yes.

### What do you wish for in the NFT space?

> I think good growth with more talents and audience.

### How would you describe the Hyper Club?

> [Team](https://twitter.com/Hyper_Club_nft) of crazy (in a good way) and very talented people I'm proud to be a part of.

### How would you describe your art? Why do you think people resonate with your artworks?

> Hmmm, with [Party Beasts](https://singular.app/collections/e84348ac164e80af0e-PARTYBEASTS), I think it's just an ode to [EDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music), and I want people to have part of their favorite genre in their NFT pockets. 
> But I am preparing something about self-awareness and self-acceptance to help people fight mental problems.

### Tell me a bit of your inspiration for your art? Does anything specific spark your style?

> It's all my life experience, a little bit of art and a sprinkle of movies

### What is the story behind the "PARTY BEASTS"? Which story do you want to tell with it?

> The main idea behind the "[Party Beasts](https://singular.app/collections/e84348ac164e80af0e-PARTYBEASTS)" collection is my obsession with electronic music, previous experience as a local DJ, and my desire to share it with people. I want to tell how we lost partying during the pandemic, and now finally it's back, and we can dance again.

### What else besides art do you enjoy doing?

> I'm a tremendous music keen. I listen to it everywhere and every time. Also, I love traveling around the globe. And pizza, I enjoy eating pizza.

### What are some of your favorite pieces that you've created?

> The "[Tech House](https://singular.app/collectibles/11851211-e84348ac164e80af0e-PARTYBEASTS-TECH_HOUSE_PARTY_BEAST-00000001)" guy was first and my favorite so far. Some incredible pieces for my future collection are on the way, and I feel proud of them.

### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> 2017 employee of the year. Jokes aside, the most significant achievement for me is that I just minted my first [collection](https://singular.app/collections/e84348ac164e80af0e-PARTYBEASTS). For years I was scared to share my artwork online. I thought I had never been good enough to show something, but now I can, and I feel excellent about it.

### Do you have any favorite artists or art pieces from the NFT community?

> All my people from [HyperClub](https://twitter.com/Hyper_Club_nft).
>  And many, many people, the list is too long to write here. 
>  And [Smearballs](https://www.instagram.com/smearballs/?utm_medium=copy_link), this guy is a nutjob (in a good way).

### Who would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> [Puma](https://twitter.com/PUMA) and [Mazda](https://twitter.com/Mazda_Europe) in my wildest dreams. 
> Back to the real world, I want to create a piece with some musician (spoiler: it's probably going to happen soon 😏))

### What is your vision as an artist in the NFT space? And what is it that excites you the most?

> NFTs give us as artists the freedom to create and share our vision, thoughts, and ideas with people everywhere. I'm excited the most about the people there - I've never seen so many open-minded and friendly people in one space. Also, I'm excited about the technology itself. 
> We can literally do everything, tell stories in a way it has never been told, create new worlds, and connect people with these technologies every day. I see something new, and every time, it blows my mind.

### If you had three wishes, what would you wish for?

> 1. Peace
> 2. Clean air
> 3. and three wishes for everyone

### Famous last words?

> Love yourself and be creative.
