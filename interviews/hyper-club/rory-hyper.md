## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be an artist? When did you start?

> Yes, the idea of being an artist never left me. From an early age, I found nothing more enjoyable than creativity. At the age of 12, I already saw the fruits of my hobby, and I really liked what I created.

  
### What brought you to the NFT space?

> One day [Rich](https://twitter.com/Rich_Valentinoo) called me and told me about this whole NFT space. He knew I drew. He suggested that we develop in that direction. And since our creative interests and ambitions are the same, I was immediately excited about it.

### What do you wish for in the NFT space?

> I want the whole NFT space to only grow. There are so many talented people pouring into the community every day. Everyone puts their heart and soul into it. It's going to be something incredible.

  
### How would you describe the Hyper Club?

> I can describe it in one very important word to me and very meaningful. 
> That word is Family.

### How would you describe your art? Why do you think people resonate with your artworks?

> I thought a lot about what direction to take in my art. And one of my favorites is the creation of full-fledged characters. That's why I chose to make my NFT debut. It's something I do with incredible pleasure. I am describing the life of the character I've created, coming up with a story, an appearance. It's very cool.

### Tell me a bit of your inspiration for your art? Does anything specific spark your style?

> You could say it's inspiring to have an idea that pops into your head all of a sudden, and you write it down so you don't forget it, and then you go back to the list of all the ideas you've ever written down, and you stop at something and think this is what I want to do right now. And to keep the momentum is very inspiring with the result and the payoff.

  
### What is the story behind the "PARALLEL LIFE"? Which story do you want to tell with it?

> Sometimes I can fantasize that I am in the far future, or on the contrary, in the past, and there is incredible technology or even magic or something else. And I thought, why can't I imagine this is possible, only in a [Parallel Life](https://singular.app/collections/966f06ede0757b8346-PARALLEL_LIFE). 
> And I transferred all this to my characters.

  
### What else besides art do you enjoy doing?

> I can take forever to enjoy spending time with my friends when I'm around my pets and watching movies, cartoons, and TV shows.

### What are some of your favorite pieces that you've created?

> If you take my collection, I really love [Kana](https://singular.app/collectibles/11837193-966f06ede0757b8346-PARALLEL_LIFE-KANA-00000001) because she's where it all started; she's the first one I thought of. 
> I also like [Megan](https://singular.app/collectibles/11837253-966f06ede0757b8346-PARALLEL_LIFE-MEGAN-00000003); that's how I often imagine myself :)

  
### What do you consider your most significant achievement so far?

> Oh, that's very funny, but I'm really proud of myself. I kneaded my own dough for the first time :) I've always avoided making it or buying ready-made dough from the store. 
> I was very happy when I made it :)

### Do you have any favorite artists or art pieces from the NFT community?

> I do not want to single out anyone. I believe in everyone. I am impressed by the work of famous artists, as well as among the beginners there are such talented guys and girls.

### Who would you like to collaborate with in the future?

> I am open to any kind of collaboration. When more imagination and skill are put into a product, it is fabulous.

  
### What is your vision as an artist in the NFT space? And what is it that excites you the most?

> I see that people love what they do. And that makes me very happy. I really like that the community supports each other, and everyone communicates. I would like it to be so always.

### If you had three wishes, what would you wish for?  

> 1. Peace in the world. 
> 2. Health to the planet. 
> 3. Let go of Jin.

  
### Famous last words?

> Logic can take you from point A to point B, and imagination can take you anywhere.
