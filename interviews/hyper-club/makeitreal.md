## Interview

### Have you always wanted to be an artist? When did you start?

> I loved to draw as a child. But I consciously started doing design at university (although I studied to be a programmer).

### What brought you to the NFT space?

> The ability to draw what you like, not what the customer wants.

### What do you wish for in the NFT space?

> My desire is to make 3d spaces. So I think metaverse is my goal.

### How would you describe the Hyper Club?

> A club of talented artists, musicians, and other team members.

### How would you describe your art? Why do you think people resonate with your artworks?

> I like to make characters with stories behind them. I hope people like it too.

### Tell me a bit of your inspiration for your art? Does anything specific spark your style?

> I find inspiration in various things - from architecture and nature to living beings and people.

> Like the mix of photoreal & toonish eclecticism. My most loved style is expressionism.

### What is the story behind the "Friends" collection? Which story do you want to tell with it?

> As I said earlier, I love creating characters. And a lot of them are born in my head. So I decided not to make a separate collection for each but to combine them into one. And since they are my [friends](https://singular.app/collections/54d552eafbcfbf1d12-IDZ93), that's what I called it :)

### What else besides art do you enjoy doing?

> Kayaking, playing djembe, discovering new ideas.

### What are some of your favorite pieces that you've created?

> Like [Raoul Duke - SphinxCat](https://singular.app/collectibles/12149824-54d552eafbcfbf1d12-3B743-SPHINXCAT_7_RAOUL_DUKE-00000007) most of all for now.

> Got family.

### What is your vision as an artist in the NFT space? And what is it that excites you the most?

> Make what you love. Freedom in art excites me most.

### If you had three wishes, what would you wish for?

> 1. Save a friend. 
> 2. Live in a warm place near the ocean. 
> 3. Be able to teleport.

### Famous last words?

> Hasta la vista, baby
